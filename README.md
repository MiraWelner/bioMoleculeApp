# Biological Molecular decoder
This is the first 'real' program I wrote! It was for Mr. Fitch, who was my chemistry teacher at the time. If you enter the name of an organic molecule such as ethanol, methane, octanoic acid, or 

# How to run it
It can be easily run using a java compiler. Navigate to the main folder which will be called `bioMoleculeApp` and type `java setupbiomolecule.ScannerClass`

This will open up a command line prompt and it will tell you the name of the compounds you put in.

NOTE: this has a somewhat limited application as it was only good for chemicals that 16 year old Mira knew how to identify. So, carboxilic acids, alkynes, etc. If you think it's too limited don't blame me, blame Mr Fitch for not teaching his class how to decode more!
